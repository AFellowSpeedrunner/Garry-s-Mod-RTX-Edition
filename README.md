# Garry-s-Mod-RTX-Edition
I have got an idea to make a really good RTX edition port of Garry's Mod in Source SDK Base 2013 multiplayer working on it Visual Studio 2013. Due to errors with the publishing of the mod, I cannot (for now) cannot release 0.3 right now. Sorry! I might release it to Steam.
